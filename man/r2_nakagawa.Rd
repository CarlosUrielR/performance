\title{Nakagawa's (2013, 2017) R2 for mixed models}
\usage{
r2_nakagawa(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A statistical model.}
}
\description{
Compute the marginal and conditional r-squared value for
 mixed effects models with complex random effects structures.
}
\details{
For mixed models (from \pkg{lme4} or \pkg{glmmTMB}) marginal and
 conditional r-squared values are calculated, based on
 \cite{Nakagawa et al. 2017}. The distributional variance (or observation-level
 variance) that is used to calculate the r-squared is based on lognormal
 approximation, \code{log(1+var(x)/mu^2)}. The marginal r-squared considers
 only the variance of the fixed effects, while the conditional r-squared
 takes both the fixed and random effects into account. The random effect
 variances are actually the mean random effect variances, thus the
 r-squared value is also appropriate for mixed models with random
 slopes (see \cite{Johnson et al. 2014}).
