Description: Utilities for computing indices to assess model quality,
    which are not directly provided by R's base or stats packages. These 
    include e.g. measures like r-squared values, intraclass correlation coefficient, 
    root mean squared errors or function to check models for overdispersion, 
    singularity or zeroinflation and more. Functions apply to a large variety of
    models, including generalized linear models, mixed effects models and Bayesian 
    models.
